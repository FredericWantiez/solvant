# SolvAnt

After almost a year after grduating and entering the world of software engineering, I have decided to revisit the ideas
surrounding linear solvers. The end goal is to have a VERY fast sparse/tridiagonal/dense solver written in modern C++.


Software architecture and clean implementation are of major concern.
